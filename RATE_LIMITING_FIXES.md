# Rate Limiting and Infinite Loop Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Supabase Rate Limiting (429 Error)
**Problem**: User was getting signed out due to too many API requests (429 Too Many Requests error)
**Root Cause**: Excessive profile save operations in a loop

### 2. Dashboard Profile Update Loop
**Problem**: Dashboard component was calling `onProfileUpdate` excessively 
**Root Cause**: No debouncing or change detection in profile updates

### 3. Empty localStorage Fallback
**Problem**: When user got signed out, localStorage contained `null`
**Root Cause**: Profile wasn't being saved to localStorage as backup

### 4. Infinite Session Check Loop
**Problem**: After signout, continuous session checking loops
**Root Cause**: No rate limiting on localStorage loading attempts

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Profile Saving Debouncing and Rate Limiting (`useProfileSaving.ts`)
- **Debouncing**: 2-second delay between saves
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 5 saves per minute
- **localStorage Backup**: Always save to localStorage even when Supabase fails
- **Save Prevention**: Skip saves already in progress

```typescript
const DEBOUNCE_DELAY = 2000; // 2 seconds between saves
const MAX_SAVES_PER_MINUTE = 5; // Maximum 5 saves per minute
const RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 60000; // 1 minute window
```

### 2. Dashboard Update Prevention (`Dashboard.tsx`)
- **Change Detection**: Only update profile when data actually changes
- **Memoized Data**: Use `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- **Debounced Updates**: 1-second debounce on profile updates
- **Reference Tracking**: Track last update to prevent loops

```typescript
// Track last updates to prevent loops
const lastSavingsUpdateRef = useRef<string>("");
const lastExpensesUpdateRef = useRef<string>("");
```

### 3. localStorage Loading Protection (`localStorageLoader.ts`)
- **Attempt Limiting**: Maximum 3 loading attempts per 10-second window
- **Loop Prevention**: Stop loading after max attempts reached
- **Reset Mechanism**: Reset counters on successful loads

```typescript
const MAX_LOAD_ATTEMPTS = 3;
const LOAD_ATTEMPT_WINDOW = 10000; // 10 seconds
```

### 4. Profile State Management (`useAuthState.ts`)
- **Dual Saving**: Save to both state and localStorage
- **Error Handling**: Continue operation even if Supabase fails
- **Cleanup**: Proper timeout cleanup on unmount

## Benefits

1. **No More Rate Limiting**: Prevents excessive API calls to Supabase
2. **Better User Experience**: No unexpected signouts
3. **Data Persistence**: Always save data to localStorage as backup
4. **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary updates and calculations
5. **Stability**: No infinite loops or excessive resource usage

## Debug Mode

- Set `DEBUG_MODE = false` in `profileCompletion.ts` 
- Users now need complete profiles (not just minimum data)
- Ensures proper onboarding flow

## Testing

To verify fixes:
1. Monitor browser console for "Rate limit reached" messages
2. Check localStorage has profile data after updates
3. Verify no continuous session loading loops
4. Test profile updates don't cause excessive saves

## Prevention

- Profile saves are now debounced and rate-limited
- localStorage always serves as backup
- Infinite loops are prevented with attempt counters
- Dashboard updates only happen when data actually changes
